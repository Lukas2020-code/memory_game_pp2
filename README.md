# The Animal Memory Game

The Animal Memory Game is fun and challenging game not only for childre but also for their parents.

This game teaches spatial imagination as well as memory. You have to find matching cards as fast as you can cause the time is counting.

This game still have several issues which I will work on it

It's still working process.
